	<!-- <h2>About Me</h2> -->

	<p class="first">

	I am a Web Developer, occasional musician, long-suffering supporter of Coventry City and sometime commentator on politics based in Coventry, West Midlands, UK.</p>

	<p>I have been working in web development for several years after a lifetime spent in the print industry, both in design and in the actual process of applying ink to paper. Indeed, I have still been involved in this until quite recently, occasionally working on both litho and letterpress. I find getting my hands literally dirty provides a welcome relief from rearranging pixels on a screen! With this background, it&#8217;s no surprise that I am a bit obsessed with good, old-fashioned values of typography and find bringing this into the digital age a fascinating challenge. In fact I am sometimes amazed by the resemblance of juggling type, leading, furniture and letterpress forms with CSS floating and positioning!</p>

	<p>In the realm of the internet, my main areas of expertise are XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. I am still more than handy from my print design days with Photoshop and Illustrator which I use to put a site together before the coding begins. I&#8217;m also pretty passionate about web compliance and accessibility standards.</p>

	<p>My other main passion is music: my tastes are eclectic, and I dabble from time to time in both improvised music (playing clarinet) and electronic music. My output in the latter field has been described as &#8220;just noise&#8221; (which is just fine by me!).</p>
