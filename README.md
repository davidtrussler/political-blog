# reason in revolt

A new blog cloned from the old davidtrussler.net site

This is a new site to contain solely blog entries of political writings. 

It was created to separate this aspect of what I do from the more general biographical, music-related and work-based site. 

The title is based on a line from The Internationale. 

The initial (and current) stage of deveopment is to strip back the old site to the absolute basics from which to build the new site. 

Will use following Front End technologies:
- BEM
- SASS
- requireJS
- SVG icons
- Karma, Mocha, Chai, Sinon for testing
