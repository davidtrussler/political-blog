# political-blog

A new blog cloned from the old davidtrussler.net site

This is a new site to contain solely blog entries of political writings. 

It was created to separtate this aspect of what I do from the more general biographical, music-related and work-based site. 

The intial (and current) stage of deveopment is to srtip back the old site to the absolute basics from which to build the new site.
