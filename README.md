# reason in revolt (initial)

This is the initial stage of a new blog cloned from the old davidtrussler.net site

It has been created to contain specifically blog entries of political writings, created to separate this aspect of what I do from the more general biographical, music-related and work-based site. 

The title is based on a line from The Internationale. 

This stage of development strips back the old site to the absolute basics from which to build the new site, whcih will use following Front End technologies:
- HTML5 (semantic elements)
- BEM
- SASS
- requireJS
- SVG icons
- Karma, Mocha, Chai, Sinon for testing
